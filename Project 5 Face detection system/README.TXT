This is a Face detectio system using the haarcascase_frontalface file
here I have used Python as language
for the libraries i have used
  cv2, imutils,os,numpy
for the function i have used
  VideoCapture to capture camera feed
  cv2Color to change the color
  detectMultiScale from frontal face variable to detect the face and save it as np array
  for making the box and text display is have used rectangle and putText
this program is for face detection not for facial recognition.

Heart Disease Classifier
This project uses Machine learning classification algorithms like LogisticRegression, KNeighboursClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier to classify if the patient has a heart disease or not.

The project steps involve:
1. Importing necessary libraries, models, and functions.
2. Getting the dataset from the source (https://www.kaggle.com/c/heart-disease-uci/data)
3. Data preparation (handling null values, removing unnecessary data, etc)
4. Visualisation to analyze the data correlation and output dependency on the data features.
5. Selecting the classifier (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)
6. Making train and test sets and training the classifiers to obtain baseline models and eliminating some models based on accuracy.
7. Model evaluation using classification report, recall score, f1 score, etc.
8. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
9. Finding the effective features using the model.

In doing so, it also acts as a tutorial template for hands-on insights on the workflow employed in Machine Learning for solving Classification Problems.
